Remember when music was fun? Remember when you danced, laughed, and sang along arm-in-arm with your friends? Remember when bands actually played real instruments while wowing you with musical chops.. you know...with guitars, drums and a honest-to-god, real horn section?

Bubba Coltrane and the Train Wrecks' goal is to make you fall in love with live music again. We are a fiery, horn-infused rock band formed out of the diverse music scene of Austin, Texas. We strive to make our shows lively, fun affairs where people dance like no one is watching and sing as if no one cared.

Bubba Coltrane and the Train Wrecks formed back at the turn of the millennium in Austin, Texas when three music nerds broke out some instruments at a party to entertain the guests. What ensued was a rollicking ride of booze, rock and roll, beer, cars, trains, love, shot blocks... and of course tons of fun!

Bubba Coltrane loves to practice! This love started when it was discovered that bassist, Ed Kuhn, brewed his own beer. The constant stream of fresh beer proved to be a great way to induce regular practices and a wonderful way to induce the marvelous musicians that have graced the stage as Train Wrecks. The main goal of the early days was having fun, discovering soul and blues music, and making sure there was room for more beer to be brewed.

Slow forward a few months later to the time when band leader Bob "Knoxious" convinced a sucker (er... good friend) that his new "free" band would be way better than the expensive band they were trying to book at their Lights in the Heights blowout. The first problem was naming the band to go on the invitation. After trying out some killer names, the name "Bubba Coltrane and the Train Wrecks" ended up on the flyer and the name has stuck like beer drenched hands on guitar strings.

The band made its way to Houston for their first gig, sans drummer. There was a vague promise that someone knew a drummer and the rest is one hour of history making music... and some good laughs and girls dancing in leather in pants. Not much else was remembered about that party (anyone know that fill-in drummer's name?) other than The Shot Block!! The band still returns to Houston every year to forget about the new things that happen at that party!

Bubba Coltrane himself never got in the van for that first show and he has been consistent in missing every show since. The lineup has changed since that first show in December 2000, but the fun, laughter, and dancing never stopped. The only constant has been "Once a Train Wreck always a Train Wreck!".

Bubba Coltrane and the Train Wrecks is a seven piece party band that sports a two guitar attack, a bull fiddle, a guy named Bob banging on the drums, and a three piece, misfit horn section that originally introduced themselves as "The Holler and Swaller Horns". Now they are just Train Wrecks til the end!

A "Bubba" Experience is a mixture of old soul, new originals, funk break downs, and party music that goes along deliciously with your favorite adult beverage. We promise to get your feet moving and your hands clapping if you just follow along to our instructions!
